# Exploring PubSub and iOS

Exploring the technology required for iOS to use [ PubSub ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern ). 
The PubSub software uses a [Nodejs] ( http://nodejs.org/ ) package 
[ MQTT.js ]( https://github.com/adamvr/MQTT.js/) and [MQTT Client SDK for Objective-C] ( https://github.com/m2mIO/mqttIO-objC ).

Rather than connect to an instrument to publish data software was developed 
to publish prime numbers to the iPhone simulator.
